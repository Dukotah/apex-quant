## Session 8 — CRITICAL data bug found: Session 7's edge-hunt results were corrupt

**The bug:** `fetch_yahoo` wrote Yahoo's split/dividend-**adjusted** close alongside
**raw** open/high/low in the same bar. The two are on different bases — in 2003 SPY's
adjusted close was ~$74 while its raw open was ~$110. The adjusted close even fell BELOW
the raw low, and `Bar.__post_init__` doesn't validate close∈[low,high], so the corrupt
bars passed silently. Effect: position sizing used the adjusted close (~$74) while fills
used the raw open (~$110) → fake ~1.5× leverage, NEGATIVE equity, garbage P&L.
**Found via** trend_bond showing an impossible 100% drawdown + sizing 1356 SPY ($150k)
on $100k; instrumented the sizer → equity 100k / price $73.7 = 1356, but fill at $110.70.

**Fix:** scale O/H/L by `adjclose/close` so the whole bar is on one (total-return) basis.
Re-fetched all data; 0 bars now have close/open outside [low,high].

**This invalidated Session 7's conclusions.** Corrected results (full-period Sharpe):
| strategy | window | Sharpe (clean) | was (corrupt) | cost-stress | corr to SPY |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| spy_trend (20/200) | 2003–26 | **0.74** | 0.40 | PASS (0.73) | 0.67 |
| dual_momentum | 2003–26 | **0.63** | 0.43 | PASS (0.61) | 0.73 |
| dual_momentum | 2011–26 | **0.61** | 0.33 | PASS (0.58) | 0.84 |
| trend_bond | 2003–26 | **0.60** | 0.10 | ~0.49 | 0.59 |
| rsi2 | 2011–26 | 0.37 | 0.33 | FAIL (0.08) | 0.32 |
| rsi2_vol | 2011–26 | 0.34 | 0.26 | FAIL (0.10) | 0.23 |
| etf_rotation | 2011–26 | 0.39 | 0.35 | FAIL (0.24) | 0.73 |
| Buy & hold SPY | — | 0.67–0.88 | — | — | 1.0 |

**Corrected conclusions:**
- **Trend/momentum strategies are genuinely decent** (~0.60–0.74 Sharpe), cost-robust,
  strong OOS — matching/beating buy-and-hold SPY. Earlier "all terrible" was the data bug.
- **Mean-reversion (rsi2 family) genuinely fails on costs** (Sharpe@2× ~0.08–0.10): high
  turnover, edge < costs. A real failure, not a data artifact.
- **The binding blocker is now Gate 1's Sharpe ≥ 1.0** — UNACHIEVABLE for any long-only
  equity strategy (even SPY itself is 0.67–0.88). This architecture's documented lane is
  long-only risk premia (Sharpe ~0.5–0.9), so a single strategy structurally cannot clear
  a 1.0 bar. To legitimately reach 1.0 you must combine UNCORRELATED sleeves (portfolio
  construction) — that is the professional path, not lowering the bar.

**Follow-ups identified:**
- Add `low ≤ open,close ≤ high` validation to `Bar.__post_init__` (would have caught this
  instantly). Deferred to avoid breaking the suite under time pressure — verify synthetic
  generator + fixtures comply first.
- Decision needed (Session 9): EITHER make Gate 1 benchmark-relative / recalibrate its
  Sharpe to the long-only lane, OR build a portfolio backtester and combine a trend/
  momentum core with the low-correlation rsi2 sleeve to genuinely exceed Sharpe 1.0.

## Session 7 — Full edge hunt: every library strategy tested on real data → none pass

**Goal:** find a strategy that PASSES the Gauntlet (the actual "product"). Tested all
five library strategies on real Yahoo OHLCV across two windows, including bear markets.

**Results (full-period Sharpe; benchmark SPY ≈ 0.67–0.88):**
| strategy | window | Sharpe | DD | grade |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| dual_momentum | 2011–26 | 0.33 | 44% | FAIL |
| dual_momentum | 2003–26 | 0.43 | 86% IS | FAIL |
| rsi2_mean_reversion | 2011–26 | 0.33 | — | FAIL (corr 0.04) |
| rsi2_vol_filtered | 2011–26 | 0.26 | 11% MC | FAIL (corr 0.01) |
| etf_rotation | 2011–26 | 0.35 | 63% | FAIL (436 trades) |
| spy_trend (20/200) | 2003–26 | 0.40 | 12% MC | FAIL |

**Conclusion: NO library strategy has a deployable edge on real data.** All cluster at
Sharpe 0.26–0.43, below the 1.0 bar; all fail Gate 5 (edge < 2× costs); most fail to
beat buy-and-hold SPY. This is the expected ~80%-fail reality and a SUCCESS for the
Gauntlet — it refused to bless mirages. Stopped iterating deliberately (further param
tweaking = the overfitting the Gauntlet prevents).

**Key findings / decisions:**
- **2011–2026 was uniquely hard** for these strategies (US-large-cap bull, SPY Sharpe
  0.88). Adding 2003–2026 (GFC + COVID) via daily history (fetch_yahoo `--start`,
  period1/period2 to dodge Yahoo's monthly downsampling on range=max) did NOT rescue
  them — dual momentum's IS drawdown ballooned to 86%.
- **The RSI2 family genuinely diversifies** (corr to SPY 0.01–0.04) and passes Monte
  Carlo — a weak but statistically-real signal. Useless standalone (sub-cost Sharpe),
  but potentially valuable as a low-correlation SLEEVE on top of an SPY core. The
  single-strategy Gauntlet can't score that; portfolio-level construction would.
- **Open measurement issue — cash-drag Sharpe.** Long/flat tactical strategies (trend,
  RSI2) sit in cash part of the time; those zero-return days dilute the Sharpe mean,
  while always-invested SPY has none. This systematically understates tactical-strategy
  Sharpe vs the benchmark. Fix candidates: park idle capital in a bond sleeve (earn
  yield, not zeros), or annualize Sharpe over invested periods only. Worth doing before
  concluding trend-following has no edge.

**Next (genuine quant research — user's call on direction):**
- Build/test mechanically-different strategies (vol-targeting, risk parity, carry,
  factor tilts) rather than re-tweaking the five that failed.
- Or pursue the portfolio angle: SPY core + low-corr RSI2 sleeve, scored at the
  portfolio level (needs a multi-strategy backtest path).
- Fix the cash-drag Sharpe artifact so tactical strategies are measured fairly.

## Session 6 — Real-data validation + live-infra prep (Milestones 1, 2a, 3 + first real edge test)

**Context:** with the framework code-complete (Session 5), the user asked to push
toward a finished *product*. Did everything achievable without the two user-only
inputs (gh auth + Alpaca keys). Tests **343 passing** (was 336).

**What was done:**
- **M1 — Alpaca adapters verified against the real SDK.** Installed alpaca-py 0.43.4
  and introspected it: all imports, TradingClient methods, request fields, enum
  *values* (buy/sell, day/gtc/ioc/fok), and Order/Position/Account/BarSet shapes
  match our adapters. **Caught one real bug:** Alpaca's `Order.status` is an
  `OrderStatus` enum whose `str()` is `"OrderStatus.FILLED"`, not `"filled"`, so
  terminal non-fill states (canceled/rejected) were never detected. Added
  `_status_str` (reads `.value`). Fills were unaffected (they key off `filled_qty`).
- **M3 — Cron hardened.** `.github/workflows/trade.yml` already called run_once
  (written ahead of the stub); now that run_once is real, added `contents: write`
  (state commit-back), a credentials preflight (clear failure when keys missing,
  not a deep crash every fire), and set the schedule to once-per-weekday near the
  close to match the daily-bar strategy (run_once is idempotent).
- **M2a — Gate 1 regime-aware min-trades.** `regime_aware_min_trades(num_bars,
  rebalance_period_bars)` caps the trade-count bar at the window's rebalance
  opportunities (floored at MIN_TRADES_FLOOR=20). Fixes the window-vs-cadence
  unfairness only; the report flags when the bar was relaxed.
- **M2b — First validation on REAL data** (no keys): `scripts/fetch_yahoo.py`
  (free adjusted-close OHLCV → feed-ready CSV) + `scripts/validate_real.py`.

**The honest edge findings — SPY/EFA/AGG, 2011-06 → 2026-06 (15y, adjusted close):**
- **dual_momentum: grade FAIL.** Full Sharpe **0.33** vs SPY **0.88**, max DD 44%,
  16 in-sample trades. Momentum rotation into EFA/AGG *underperformed* buy-and-hold
  SPY through the US-led bull market. (Gate 1 count check correctly stayed at 50 —
  ~125 monthly opportunities in 15y ≥ 50 — so the M2a relaxation didn't fire; the
  FAIL is real, on Sharpe + DD.)
- **rsi2_mean_reversion: grade FAIL.** 127 trades, full Sharpe **0.33**, OOS 70% of
  IS, **corr to SPY 0.03** (a genuine diversifier!), but Monte Carlo p=0.051 and
  Sharpe collapses below costs at 2x slippage. A weak, non-robust signal.

**Key decisions / findings:**
- **Neither starter strategy is deployable as-is on real data.** This is a success
  for the Gauntlet, not a failure of the project — mirages died in code, not in the
  account. The product's value gate is now clearly "find a strategy that PASSES."
- **Measurement bug fixed:** the single-strategy SLEEVE_RISK config relaxed the
  drawdown halt but left the 2% daily-loss breaker on, repeatedly halting RSI2 and
  distorting its raw-edge Sharpe. Relaxed `max_daily_loss_pct` for raw-edge runs
  (in both validate_real.py and run_backtest.py). This is ONLY for measuring an
  isolated strategy's edge — live multi-strategy capital keeps the real breakers.
- **Data via Yahoo, not Stooq** (Stooq now requires an API key). fetch_yahoo uses
  stdlib urllib + a User-Agent, skips null/holiday bars, prefers adjusted close.
  Downloaded data is git-ignored (regenerable).

**RESOLVED later in Session 6 — went live on paper:**
- ✅ **Backed up to GitHub** (private repo Dukotah/apex-quant) via gh device-flow auth.
- ✅ **Live path verified against the real Alpaca paper API** (locally): the adapters
  fetched 1041 real IEX bars (0 skipped/gaps), reconciled the account, and the cycle
  exited clean. Fixed one cosmetic bug (cp1252 console crashed on '→' in the summary).
- ✅ **GitHub Actions secrets + variables set** (ALPACA_API_KEY/SECRET, APEX_MODE=paper,
  APEX_BROKER=alpaca) via `gh secret/variable set`.
- ✅ **Cron verified GREEN end-to-end in the GitHub runner** (workflow_dispatch): install
  → credentials preflight → run_once against Alpaca paper → state committed back. The
  scheduled runner now fires every weekday 19:50 UTC. **The 30-day paper gate clock has
  effectively started.**

**Next (the remaining real work):**
- **Find a real edge.** Both starters FAIL on real data. Candidates: re-test dual
  momentum on a different regime / wider universe; run the vol-filtered RSI2 and
  ETF-rotation starters on real data; explore RSI2's near-zero SPY correlation (0.03)
  as a diversifying *sleeve* rather than a standalone strategy.
- **Let the paper cron run ~30 days** and watch with the DriftMonitor before any live
  capital (CLAUDE.md rule 17). Do NOT flip APEX_MODE=live until a strategy has both
  passed the Gauntlet AND proven on paper.
- Minor: bump actions/checkout + setup-python for the Node20→24 deprecation (warning
  only, non-blocking).

## Session 5 — The live path: normalizer + Alpaca feed + Alpaca execution + run_once

**Context:** the user explicitly overrode the one-module-per-session Golden Rule
(as in Session 2) to finish ALL four remaining 🔲 modules in one sweep and get the
repo onto GitHub. The Session 4 blocker was "the live modules need the Alpaca SDK
+ keys + network, so they can't be built test-first offline." Resolved by a
dependency-injection pattern: isolate every SDK/network call behind one injectable
seam per module, so all *logic* is unit-tested offline with fakes and only a thin,
documented adapter needs live verification. Tests **336 passing** (was 273, +63).

**What was built:**
- `apex/data/normalizer.py` (+24 tests) — the single raw→Bar/Tick translation
  boundary. UTC timestamps (datetime/ISO/Zulu/epoch s+ms), Decimal money via
  `str()`, dict rows + SDK attribute objects. Pure/offline; fails loud so callers
  choose skip-or-abort. Both feeds normalize through it.
- `apex/data/alpaca_feed.py` (+15 tests) — on-demand real OHLCV for the cron model:
  fetch a finite [start,end] window, normalize + sort, replay as the SAME
  MarketEvent stream the engine already drives (so one engine runs backtest AND
  live). SDK call isolated behind an injectable `bar_fetcher`; retry/backoff, gap
  detection, bad-bar skipping, lookback trimming all tested offline.
- `apex/execution/alpaca.py` (+17 tests) — real order submission, fail-safe by
  construction. Idempotent submits (stable `client_order_id`, broker is source of
  truth — no double-send on a re-fired cron); **broker-truth fills** (only the
  quantity/price the broker confirms is booked, never an estimate); partial fills;
  fill polling with injected backoff; disconnect = safe mode (cancel working
  orders); startup position reconciliation. SDK behind an injectable `BrokerClient`.
- `apex/execution/factory.py` — wired paper→AlpacaExecutionEngine(paper=True),
  live→AlpacaExecutionEngine(paper=False). The paper/live switch is now real.
- `scripts/run_once.py` (+6 tests) — the cron entry point. ONE cycle: build from
  config → reconcile broker truth into the portfolio → fetch recent window → warm
  strategies, act only on the LATEST bar's signals → risk-evaluate (exits first) →
  submit → persist to SQLite (stdlib `StateStore`) → exit. Fully injectable; the
  whole cycle runs offline against the simulator.

**Key decisions:**
- **Dependency injection is how we satisfy Golden Rule 12 for live code.** Each
  live module takes an injectable seam (`bar_fetcher` / `BrokerClient` / the whole
  collaborator set in run_once). Logic is 100% tested with fakes; the real adapter
  is a tiny `# pragma: no cover` wrapper verified in paper, not CI.
- **Broker-truth fills (the most important safety call).** A live FillEvent is
  emitted ONLY from the broker's reported `filled_qty`/`filled_avg_price`. If an
  order is still working when the cron process exits, NO fill is booked — the next
  run's reconciliation reflects reality. This preserves backtest/live parity: a
  position changes only on a confirmed fill, never an optimistic local guess.
- **Idempotency via the OrderEvent id.** Each order's stable `event_id` becomes the
  Alpaca `client_order_id`; we check the broker for it before submitting, so a
  re-fired cron run can never double-submit. The broker, not our memory, is truth.
- **Cron model, not a daemon.** run_once fetches a finite window and acts on the
  latest bar — no always-on websocket. A market order placed now fills at the next
  print (≈ next open), so there is no look-ahead and no long-running process to
  babysit. Matches the free GitHub Actions runner.
- **Reconciliation seeds the portfolio via the public fill API** (synthetic fill at
  the broker's avg entry → equity unchanged at seed, then marked to market on
  replay). No new portfolio mutation surface; the frozen Portfolio is untouched.
- **Bug caught by the integration test:** run_once initially appended fills to the
  report but never called `portfolio.on_fill` — the risk loop wasn't closed. Fixed
  the fill handler to book into the portfolio AND record. Exactly why the cycle is
  tested end-to-end, not just unit-tested.

**Verified:** full suite 336 passing in ~3.4s. The paper/live switch is now a pure
config change end to end (`APEX_MODE`/`APEX_BROKER`), with the live broker behind
tested fail-safes.

**Next (needs real infra — the honest remaining work):**
- Drop in real Alpaca **paper keys** and run `python -m scripts.run_once`
  (APEX_MODE=paper, APEX_BROKER=alpaca) to verify the live adapters against the
  real SDK end to end. This is the only part the offline tests can't cover.
- Wire the GitHub Actions cron (`.github/workflows/trade.yml`) to call run_once on
  a schedule once paper keys are in repo secrets.
- Begin the **30-day paper-trading gate** (CLAUDE.md rule 17) before any live
  capital, with the DriftMonitor watching for alpha decay.
- Revisit Gate 1's `MIN_TRADES=50` (Session 2 finding) so low-turnover dual
  momentum is graded fairly.

---

## Session 4 — File → Gauntlet bridge (validate on real history)

**What was built (+1 test → 273 total):**
- `apex/backtest/gauntlet_runner.run_gauntlet_from_csv(...)` — loads an OHLCV
  CSV/Parquet through `HistoricalDataFeed` and runs the full 7-gate Gauntlet. The
  one-call path to validate a strategy on ACTUAL history: drop in a real OHLCV file
  and nothing else changes. Tested end-to-end (file → feed → engine → all 7 gates).

**Blocker for the live path (needs your input):** the remaining roadmap items —
`alpaca_feed.py`, `execution/alpaca.py`, `scripts/run_once.py` — all require the
Alpaca SDK + live/paper credentials + network, so they can't be built test-first
offline (Golden Rule 12). To proceed I need either (a) a real OHLCV CSV to validate
strategies on real history now, or (b) Alpaca paper keys to build/verify the live path.

---

## Session 3 — Drift monitor (the alpha-decay kill switch)

**What was built (+10 tests → 272 total):**
- `apex/validation/drift_monitor.py` — `DriftMonitor`: tracks a live strategy's
  rolling Sharpe and AUTO-QUARANTINES when it decays below the floor
  (0.70 × validated Sharpe, matching `gauntlet.grade_and_assemble`). Completes the
  "Gauntlet never stops" story from docs/VALIDATION_GAUNTLET.md.

**Key decisions:**
- **Quarantine is STICKY.** Once tripped, a later run of good returns does NOT
  auto-reactivate the strategy — only a human `reset()` (after investigating the
  decay) lifts it. A kill switch that silently un-trips isn't a kill switch.
- **Won't judge on too little data.** Below `min_observations` (default = window)
  the state is WARMING_UP, never QUARANTINED — avoids false alarms from a thin
  sample. Conversely, `validated_sharpe <= 0` raises (a live strategy has a
  positive validated edge by definition; fail closed on misconfiguration).
- **Accepts returns OR equity points** (`record_return` / `record_equity`), and a
  `from_gauntlet_report` constructor recovers the validated Sharpe from the report's
  quarantine floor. Pure stdlib (deque + metrics), deterministic.

**Next:** real data ingestion (`alpaca_feed.py` / load real OHLCV CSVs into the
HistoricalDataFeed) to run the Gauntlet on actual history; then `execution/alpaca.py`
+ `scripts/run_once.py` (cron entry) + SQLite state persistence for paper trading.

---

## Session 2 — Massive sweep: Phase 2 data feed, Phase 4/5 modules, all 4 strategies, full Gauntlet integration

**Context:** the repo had been delivered as an unextracted tarball
(`Downloads/apex-quant.tar.gz`); extracted to `~/apex-quant`. Baseline confirmed
at 79 tests. This session took the suite to **262 tests passing**.

**What was built (one parallel sweep + sequential integration):**
- `apex/data/historical_feed.py` — CSV/Parquet replay → chronological MarketEvents
  (stdlib CSV core, lazy-pandas Parquet, stable sort, bad-row skip+count). +15 tests.
- `apex/risk/portfolio.py` — position/cash/equity/drawdown tracker exposing the exact
  6-attr snapshot the RiskManager reads. +20 tests.
- `apex/execution/simulated.py` — deterministic paper fills (adverse slippage +
  commission, "SIM-N" ids, fail-closed on no-price / non-MARKET). +39 tests.
- `apex/execution/factory.py` — the ONE mode→engine switch (backtest/paper→sim,
  live→NotImplementedError, fail-closed).
- `apex/execution/engine.py` — `TradingEngine` orchestrator: next-bar-open fills
  (no look-ahead), per-day equity, trade-return capture, halt enforcement, strategy
  quarantine. +10 tests (with factory).
- `apex/backtest/{synthetic,backtester,gauntlet_runner}.py` — the adapter that turns a
  strategy run into `(equity_curve, trade_returns)` and drives all 7 Gauntlet gates;
  seeded synthetic data generator for reproducible demos. +4 tests.
- `scripts/run_backtest.py` — capstone CLI: runs dual_momentum / rsi2 through the full Gauntlet.
- Strategies implemented from their stubs: `dual_momentum`, `rsi2_mean_reversion`,
  `rsi2_vol_filtered`, `etf_rotation` (+57 strategy tests).
- `tests/test_risk_manager.py` — formalized the smoke test into 38 cases.

**Key decisions:**
- **RiskManager made reduce-aware (FROZEN FILE EDIT — explicitly approved).** The
  original sizer sized *every* signal (incl. SELL-to-exit) by remaining exposure room,
  so once fully invested an exit sized to 0 and was rejected — no strategy could close
  or rotate. Added a reduce path: a SELL-while-long / BUY-while-short is sized to flatten
  (≤ held qty), exempt from the exposure/leverage caps and the mandatory-stop requirement
  (de-risking must always be allowed). Entry behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged; all 38
  risk tests still pass. *A risk manager that won't let you close a position is itself a bug.*
- **Engine sizes entries against a portfolio projected free of pending exits.** A rotation
  emits SELL(old)+BUY(new) in one bar; the BUY would otherwise be sized against the still-
  invested portfolio and rejected. `_project_after_exits` removes the exiting positions'
  exposure so the BUY sizes into the capital its SELL is about to free. Both fill next-open.
- **Two engine bugs found via end-to-end runs and fixed:** (1) the drawdown/daily-loss halt
  is *lazy* — only evaluated when a signal is processed (fine in practice, documented);
  (2) the engine reset the portfolio's daily baseline but never called
  `risk_manager.reset_daily()`, so a daily-loss halt was *permanent* — it silently killed
  ~90% of RSI2's trades (9 vs 89). Now reset on each day boundary (drawdown halts stay sticky).
- **No look-ahead:** signals decided on bar T's close fill at bar T+1's open. The single
  most important anti-overfitting property of the backtester.
- **Single-strategy backtests use a full-deployment RiskConfig** (100% position/exposure);
  the 5%/50% retail caps are for multi-strategy *live* capital sharing, not for measuring
  one strategy's raw edge through the Gauntlet.
- **Synthetic data caveat:** no market-data vendor is wired yet, so demos use a seeded
  synthetic generator. Grades demonstrate the *pipeline*, not a real edge. Swap in a
  HistoricalDataFeed on real OHLCV for a real run — nothing else changes.

**Verified end-to-end:** dual_momentum rotates SPY↔EFA↔AGG and runs all 7 gates →
honest **FAIL** (only ~10 trades < the 50-trade significance bar; low-turnover by nature).
RSI2 runs all 7 gates with real statistics (89 trades, Monte Carlo actually executes) →
honest **FAIL** on edgeless random-walk data. The Gauntlet's ability to *pass* a real edge
remains covered by `test_gauntlet.py`.

**Honest finding to revisit:** Gate 1's `MIN_TRADES=50` structurally fails low-turnover
strategies (monthly dual momentum). Consider a regime-aware minimum (e.g. scale by
rebalance frequency) so the anchor strategy can be fairly graded.

**Next:** real data ingestion (`alpaca_feed.py` / load real OHLCV CSVs) to run the Gauntlet
on actual history; then `execution/alpaca.py` + wire `run_once.py` for paper trading.

---

## Session 1 — Phase 1 complete + indicators + first strategy

**What was built (all tested — 79 tests total passing):**
- `apex/core/event_bus.py` — central FIFO queue + pub/sub. Thread-safe, never
  drops events, fails loud (re-raises handler errors after running all handlers).
- `apex/core/clock.py` — `Clock` ABC, `RealClock` (wall UTC), `SimulatedClock`
  (backtest, enforces monotonicity — time can't go backward).
- `apex/strategy/indicators.py` — SMA, EMA, RSI (Wilder), MACD, Bollinger Bands,
  ATR, rolling_return, crosses_above/below. Same-length output, None during
  warmup, deterministic. Verified against hand-computed values.
- `apex/strategy/library/sma_crossover.py` — first COMPLETE working strategy.
  Validates the whole pipeline: bars → indicator → SignalEvent. Long/flat with
  suggested stop. Self-contained price buffer, fully unit-tested.

**Key decisions:**
- Indicators work in float internally (speed, comparative) while money math stays
  Decimal elsewhere.
- Clock monotonicity enforced — out-of-order bars raise, never silently corrupt.
- Event bus fails loud — a raising subscriber doesn't get swallowed.
- Strategies keep their own price buffer (testable in isolation). SMA crossover
  is the template shape for all future strategies.
- SMA crossover is a pipeline test / teaching example, NOT a deploy target.

**Status:** Phase 1 DONE. Phase 3 indicators + reference strategy DONE. Vertical
slice works end-to-end (data → strategy → risk → validation).

**Next (dependency order):** historical_feed.py (Phase 2) → portfolio.py (Phase 4)
→ simulated execution + engine + backtester (Phase 5, activates remaining Gauntlet
gates) → implement real strategies (dual_momentum first) → run full Gauntlet.

---

## Session 0.6 — The Validation Gauntlet (the differentiator)

**What was built (all tested, 28 tests passing):**
- `docs/VALIDATION_GAUNTLET.md` — full spec of the 7-gate validation system.
- `apex/validation/metrics.py` — Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, profit factor,
  Calmar, correlation, annualized return. Pure stdlib, hand-verified.
- `apex/validation/monte_carlo.py` — Gate 4. Bootstrap + sign-randomized null
  hypothesis. Distinguishes real edge from lucky sequence; outputs realistic
  (95th-pct) drawdown to size around. Seeded/reproducible.
- `apex/validation/walk_forward.py` — Gate 3. Rolling train/test windowing that
  stitches out-of-sample test curves. Backtest fn injected (plugs into Phase 5).
- `apex/validation/gauntlet.py` — orchestrator. All 7 gates + grading rubric
  (A/B/C/FAIL) + auto-quarantine floor computation. Outputs an honest graded
  report, never a profit promise.

**Key decisions:**
- **The Gauntlet is THE differentiator.** Not strategy cleverness — validation
  rigor. Its job is to make overfitting expensive: mirages die cheaply in code,
  not expensively in the live account.
- **7 gates:** in-sample sanity, out-of-sample holdout, walk-forward, Monte
  Carlo, cost stress, parameter sensitivity, benchmark/correlation. Gates 1-5 are
  hard fails; 6-7 can only warn (a diversifier with mild param sensitivity can
  still earn a place).
- **Output is a confidence GRADE, not a profit promise.** Explicitly designed to
  never claim profitability — only "if there's a real edge, we haven't fooled
  ourselves; if not, we gave it every chance to expose itself."
- **Size around the Monte Carlo realistic drawdown**, never the backtest's lucky
  DD. This is baked into the report.
- **Auto-quarantine floor = 70% of validated Sharpe.** The alpha-decay kill switch.
- **Stdlib-only** (math/statistics/random) so it runs on the free CI runner with
  no heavy installs.

**Verified end-to-end:** a real edge passes all gates (grade A); an overfit
mirage with in-sample Sharpe 7.12 gets killed at Gate 2 (OOS Sharpe collapses to
12% of in-sample). Exactly the intended behavior.

**What still needs Phase 5:** cost-stress and parameter-sweep gates have
framework code but need the real backtester to feed them equity curves. Drift
monitor (live-vs-backtest) still to build.

**Next:** Phase 1 finish — `event_bus.py` + `clock.py`. Then the backtester
(Phase 5) so the remaining gates activate against real strategy runs.

---

## Session 0.5 — Strategy Research & Starter Specs

**What was added:**
- `docs/STRATEGY_PLAYBOOK.md` — researched strategy guidance (June 2026).
- Four spec'd strategy stubs in `apex/strategy/library/` with full rules in
  docstrings: `dual_momentum.py`, `rsi2_mean_reversion.py`,
  `rsi2_vol_filtered.py`, `etf_rotation.py`. All raise NotImplementedError until
  built in Phase 3.

**Key decisions (grounded in research):**
- **This architecture's lane = low-frequency, daily-or-slower, rules-based
  strategies harvesting documented risk premia.** NOT HFT/scalping/market-making
  (no latency edge; we'd be retail order-flow fodder).
- **Build order: Dual Momentum first.** Lowest turnover, fewest params, monthly
  rebalance, built-in absolute-momentum drawdown switch. Then RSI(2) as the
  complementary tactical sleeve (capped 15-25% of capital).
- **Run momentum + mean-reversion together** — uncorrelated edges smooth the
  equity curve (they win in different regimes).
- **Alpha decay is assumed, not hoped against.** Strategy Lifecycle: quarantine
  any strategy whose live Sharpe < 70% of backtest Sharpe for 30 days.
- **Backtest validation gates mandatory** (Sharpe ≥1.0, walk-forward OOS ≥70% of
  in-sample, max DD ≤25%, ≥50 trades, profit factor ≥1.3, survives slippage).
  Enforced in code.
- **Honest baseline acknowledged:** ~90% of retail algos fail year one; ~80% of
  good-backtest strategies fail live. Edge = discipline + survival, enforced by
  the RiskManager + 30-day paper gate.

**Next:** Phase 1 finish — `event_bus.py` + `clock.py` + model/event tests.

## Session 0 — Framework Foundation (initial scaffold)

**What was built:**
- `apex/core/models.py` — asset-agnostic frozen data models: `Bar`, `Tick`,
  `Symbol` (with `AssetClass` enum + contract multiplier for futures/crypto),
  `Position`, and order enums. Bars self-validate in `__post_init__` (reject
  negative prices, high<low, naive timestamps).
- `apex/core/events.py` — the event taxonomy: `MarketEvent`, `SignalEvent`,
  `OrderEvent`, `FillEvent`, `HaltEvent`. All frozen. Each event carries a UUID
  and links back to its parent (signal_id, order_id) for full traceability.
- `apex/core/config.py` — `AppConfig` with the `ExecutionMode` switch
  (backtest/paper/live) and `Broker` enum. `from_env()` raises if LIVE is paired
  with the simulated broker (safety).
- `apex/data/base_feed.py` — `BaseDataFeed` ABC. Context-manager support.
- `apex/strategy/base_strategy.py` — `BaseStrategy` ABC with `on_bar`/`on_tick`
  hooks + `StrategyContext` (read-only state view).
- `apex/risk/risk_manager.py` — `RiskManager` (the gatekeeper) + frozen
  `RiskConfig`. Smoke-tested and working.
- `apex/execution/base_execution.py` — `BaseExecutionEngine` ABC with the
  paper/live abstraction and fill-callback wiring.

**Key design decisions (the "why"):**
- **Signals carry conviction (`strength` 0..1), not quantity.** Strategies express
  *how confident*, the risk manager translates that into *how many shares* within
  hard caps. This keeps sizing logic in exactly one place.
- **Position sizing lives inside the RiskManager**, not a separate sizer module
  (for now). It's tightly coupled to the exposure/leverage checks, so co-locating
  prevents a signal being "approved" then separately "sized too big."
- **Risk checks fail closed** — the `evaluate()` method wraps everything in
  try/except and REJECTS on any exception. Safety beats availability.
- **Drawdown breach sets a persistent `_halted` flag** on the risk manager and
  emits a `HaltEvent`. Daily-loss halts can be reset via `reset_daily()`;
  drawdown halts are sticky until manual review.
- **Decimal everywhere for money.** No floats in price/quantity/cash math.
- **All timestamps UTC, timezone-aware**, enforced at model construction.

**Verified:**
- Smoke test passed: compliant signal → 25 shares of AAPL ($100k equity × 5% ÷
  $200); missing stop → rejected; 15% drawdown → system halt + rejection.

**Free-stack decisions:**
- Broker: **Alpaca** (free paper, commission-free live, IEX free data feed).
- Runtime: **GitHub Actions cron** for scheduled runs (free, public repo);
  **Oracle Cloud Always Free** VM if a persistent process is ever needed.
- State: **SQLite** in-repo to start (zero setup); Supabase free tier if the
  dashboard sibling project is wired in.
- AI: strategies authored in **Claude Pro chat** and pasted in → $0 API cost.
  Runtime is fully deterministic and calls no LLM.

**Next:** Phase 1 finish — `event_bus.py` + `clock.py` + model/event tests.
